# sparta-SDET-unit_testing-fizzbuzz

## Main
The main purpose of this repository was to initiate my activity as a Software Tester into Unit Testing.
In this task we used Ruby language.

> A unit test is the smallest testable part of an application like functions, classes, procedures, interfaces. Unit testing is a method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use.

Basically with the FizzBuzz challenge, we had to write small modules of code and test them.
For this, we used the TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach, where we first have to make the test fail (Red), then pass (Green) and last, Refactor it, which means to make it as DRY and readable as possible keeping the same characteristics and functions.
